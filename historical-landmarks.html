        <strong>Description:</strong> Standing guard at the mouth of the Belize River, the Baron Bliss Lighthouse is a cherished symbol of Belize City. It was erected in memory of Baron Henry Edward Ernest Victor Bliss, a great benefactor to the nation who, despite never setting foot on its soil, fell in love with Belize's coast and left his fortune to its people. The nearby sign, a popular photo spot, proudly welcomes all to the country.
